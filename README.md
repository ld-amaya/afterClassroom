### ABOUT
We all know the pandemic brought to us a new normal, and lucky for some sectors or organization who have been built to handle work-from-home or remote work. But for most of the business, especially the schools in third world country like the Philippines, the current system is not at all ready.
This project is inspired in providing a solution to a school problem. afterClassroom tries to connect the student and teachers so that education can still continue to flow even remotely.
afterClassroom is an ecosystem for teachers and students where students can take practice test using the test questions uploaded or provided by their own teachers. 
The goal of this project is much more bigger, this mvp will allow us to identify the path and prioritize functionalities that the teachers and students needs.
